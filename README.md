## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DimeDimitrov.
### I started using github actively in 2023, but I've been coding since 2020.
### I started by learning C++ basics at the end of my primary school. During highschool i learned the basics of Python and dove right into JavaScript.
### The process of learning Javascript was really fun for me, following different tutorials and experimenting. I then stumbled upon Web Development and learned React and Vue.
### I'm currently working on improving my portfolio and experimenting and learning new things. Hopefully in the future some of my open-source projects can be of use to someone.
